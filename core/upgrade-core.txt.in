# This script can be used to upgrade a Zenoss deployment to a new image
#
# To minimize downtime and avoid potential out of space disk issues,
# preseed the master with the images (that the upgrade will automatically
# pull from the internet) before the upgrade maintenance window:
#   ssh MASTER
#       sudo docker pull zenoss/core_%SHORT_VERSION%:%VERSION%    # about 10-20 minutes
#       sudo docker pull zenoss/hbase:%HBASE_VERSION%        # about  5-10 minutes
#       sudo docker pull zenoss/opentsdb:%OPENTSDB_VERSION%      # about  7-15 minutes
#       serviced docker sync                      # about 10m:core 5m:hbase 8m:opentsdb
#
# Run via 'serviced script run upgrade-core.txt --service Zenoss.core' and restart
# the deployment
